    <img src="`">
    <P>
        I want to be a <strong>programmer </strong>. This is the big dream <br>of
        my life. I want to do it as soon as possible.That's why I have to do:
        <ol>
            <li>Hard Work</li>
            <li>determind About my code</li>
            <li>Dedicated about on study</li>
            <li>Do Regular code</li>

            
        </ol>
        On the otherhand , Programming is very essential for a coder as a CSE student. At departmant of CSE every student <br>
        should do code for their future. You have to be determind about it . That's why <br>
        we have to maintain some routine:
        <ul>
            <li>set on chair  long  time for coding</li>
            <li>everyday solve some problem for w3 school</li>
        </ul>
    </P>
